Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

After each plot add a sentence or too explaining what the code is and analyzing.
Your next objective is to run linear regression on each relationship, only this time separating them into Northern Hemisphere (greater than or equal to 0 degrees latitude) and Southern Hemisphere (less than 0 degrees latitude):

Northern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
Southern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
Northern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
Southern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
Northern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
Southern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
Northern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
Southern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

After each pair of plots explain what the linear regression is modelling such as any relationships you notice and any other analysis you may have.
Your final notebook must:

Randomly select at least 500 unique (non-repeat) cities based on latitude and longitude.
Perform a weather check on each of the cities using a series of successive API calls.
Include a print log of each city as it's being processed with the city number and city name.
Save a CSV of all retrieved data and a PNG image for each scatter plot.
